## Notes on tackling olympiad problem in an efficient way 

Note, this repository is implemented in Kotlin. If you plan to interview in another 
language its not a problem. Focus on the concepts rather than specific syntax in this repo
and think about how to implement a similar thing in your language.

Use this guide as a starting point and then you can read the "Cracking the coding interview" book.

# 1. Practice makes perfect. 
Workout here https://leetcode.com/

# 2. It is necessary to learn a bit of theory to handle such problems.
Watch this channel. Its the best content of this kind on Youtube.
Start with something simple and then progress.

Check out the WilliamFiset youtube channel.

# 3. Read a couple of guides about solving problems of this kind

1. https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed

# 4. Know how to use the most common data structures in your programming language
In order to solve live coding problems fast, you need to have the most common API 
methods memorized. Check out the test folder in this repository. It provides you 
with the most common idioms to use the most common DS in kotlint

# 5. Know your stuff 
To ace 99% of the coding problems, you need to have a rather limited amount of tools in your box.
But you need to know how to use and apply it fast.

Here's a list of the algorithms and data structures you need to know 
## Big-O notation
Here's an explanation: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/my-first-foray-into-technology-c5b6e83fe8f1/
## Algorithm and data structure operations Big-O complexity
Here's a cheat sheet.
You need to have an intuitive understanding of why the complexity is this or 
that for a given operation.
